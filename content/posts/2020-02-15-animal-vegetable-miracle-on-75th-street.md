This past Christmas, I was the lucky recipient of the above mentioned work, Barbara Kingsolver’s*Animal, Vegetable, Miracle: A Year of Food Life*.

*AVM*tells the story of Kingsolver moving her Tuscon-based family (two daughters and husband) to a farm in Virginia and spending the following year consuming only products they had grown themselves or procured from other local farmers and producers. Chapters are broken into months and the corresponding seasonal crop or animal Kingsolver’s family is planting or harvesting at the time; from asparagus (never thought I’d appreciate an author waxing poetic about asparagus…) to pet chickens her daughter ruthlessly bargains to sell for meat. There’s so much I love about the book, I won’t go on and on about it. Trust me, if you’re interested in plants, food, gardening, or want to start learning more about any of those things, you should just read it.

The part that really jarred my brain, however, was how Kingsolver details not only the toil required to grow your own food, but also the completely overlooked fact that food⁠—*real* food⁠—grows on a seasonal cycle and is naturally available for a limited time only.

**Let’s pause for a seemingly obvious reality check.**  In the real world, outside the confines of our local grocery stores, most of us do not live in places where pineapples can be harvested for eating in February and sweet potatoes in June. I don’t know where that perfect, all-food-all-the-time-naturally exists. Maybe Florida. I digress.

Folks: fruits, vegetables and herbs are not naturally available year-round! But, modern consumers that we are, we’ve become fully accustomed to eating whatever we want, whenever we want; because it’s always right there, waiting for us at the grocery store. The sad result of purchasing and eating this way, free from seasonal shackles, is that our food ends up traveling thousands of miles to reach our plates; racking up extraordinary costs on fuel (read: gasoline) and the environment (read: industrialized agriculture).

**I have a confession:**I have considered myself a “conscious shopper” because I was an “outside circle shopper” at the grocery store, meaning I try to keep my grocery lists limited to eggs, meat, veggies and fruit with limited center-aisle items, AKA those yummy sodium bombs which come pre-cooked or are cooked in the microwave. My usual list would look something like this, depending on what my husband and I were feeling that given week….but keep in mind, this barely changes season to season:

* **Vegetables:**Baby carrots (let’s talk about what these actually are at some point…like, is someone*hurting you*, baby carrots?!) cucumbers, cherry tomatoes, bell peppers, the least-offensive looking bag of spinach I could find, sweet potatoes, green beans, maybe a zucchini or squash once I had been gifted a zoodler.
* **Fruits:**Apples, literally all the berries, bananas we never finished in time, pineapple, grapes. Lemons and limes.
* **Dairy:**Cheese (Can’t not have cheese,) milk (sometimes half and half, sometimes 2%, recently; oat milk,) yogurt, eggs.
* **Meat/Seafood:**Chicken thighs, ground beef/turkey/pork, pork chops, salmon, occasionally steak, bacon. Always tried to get “organic” labeled meat when I could afford it, but we’ll chat re: organic product labeling in the near future. (Spoiler alert: Stop feeling good about yourself for buying it. Sorry.)

So…yeah. I’m reading the book, realizing that my purchasing and consumption habits really are*not*that great, and thinking about what I can realistically do to start changing this. A few options come to mind:

* **Find a local farmer’s market and shop at it as much as possible.**

  * Benefits:

    * Supporting local-to-localish farmers and producers with your $ rather than Massive Faceless Farm Corporation
    * The products will nearly always be in season
    * The products are traveling shorter distances to reach you
    * The products you encounter will include seasonal items you’re not used to seeing and may try for the first time.
  * Drawbacks:

    * Not available locally to everyone
    * Not year-round (you’ll have to go to the grocery at some point in time, unless you’re a pro at this and are canning/freezing your leftover produce a la Kingsolver in*AVM*)
    * Can be limited to cash-only options; although[SNAP/EBT is readily accepted](http://snaptomarket.com/)at New York-based farmers markers
* **Find a CSA and get a subscription**.

  * Benefits:

    * Essentially a delivered-to-your door option of the farmer’s market, minus the ability to pick and choose what you want.
  * Drawbacks:

    * Costs money. Not an option for those on a limited income. Need to do some research if also supported by SNAP/EBT…they should be!
* **Grow your own fruits and vegetables**.

  * Benefits:

    * Develop a cool new skill\*\*, learn about plants, become a steward of the earth

      * This will become extra handy if we continually hurtle towards nuclear apocalypse, so desert farmers, I’m looking at you.\*\*
    * Decreased time spent doing less productive things (TV, cellphone, whatever) and more time in nature
    * Access to fresh food, hand-selected by you
  * Drawbacks:

    * Costs money to purchase soil, pots, seeds, etc.
    * Time investment
    * Requires space to grow your plants
    * Ultimately may not work that well (blight, bad weather, whatever.) So a lot of sunk work for no guaranteed results.
* **Try to make your grocery shopping list more seasonally-friendly.**

  * Benefits:

    * See points re: fuel and industrial agriculture earlier in post.
  * Drawbacks:

    * Still shopping at a grocery store; unless you read the labels you’re likely not purchasing from somewhere that isn’t Florida, California, etc. (Unless you live there…in which case, revert to the previous option and grow your own, if possible?)

After weighing the above options, my totally-rational mind picked the most work intensive option…to grow my own garden, right where I live, in Manhattan. On my roof. For the first time.

I swear, besides all of the above mentioned stuff…I have a really good reason. Which I’m dedicating my next post to.  I’ll give you a clue:

> “Many of us who aren’t farmers or gardeners still have some element of farm nostalgia in our family past, real or imagined: a secret longing for some connection to a life where a rooster crows in the yard.”

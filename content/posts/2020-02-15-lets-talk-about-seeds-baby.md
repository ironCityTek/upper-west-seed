What’s the difference between all the seeds you see at Home Depot, anyway? There’s just one type of seeds, right? The ones that grow stuff? Let’s just buy those and call it a day.

Turns out, there are a *lot* of differences. Like, some weird Franken-seed differences I’d certainly want to know before spending another 30+ years eating this stuff. This post will cover three categories of seeds: GMO, hybrid, and heirloom (which I picked for my garden).

Here’s how Kingsolver breaks them down in *AVM*:

**HYBRID SEEDS**

*“Vegetables acquire histories when they are saved as seeds for many generations, carefully maintained and passed on by hand from one gardened to another. Heirlooms are open-pollinated–as opposed to hybrids, which are the one-time product of a forced cross between dissimilar varieties of a plant.*

*These crosses do rely on the sex organs of the plant to get pollen into ovaries, so they’re still limited to members of the same species: tall corn with early corn, for example, or prolific cucumbers with non-prickly ones, in blends that combine the ideal traits of both parents for one-time-only offspring.*

*\[Hybrid seeds] have slowly colonized and then dominated our catalogs and then our croplands. Because of their unnatural parentage they offer special vigor, but the next generation of these crosses will be of an unpredictable and mostly undesirable character.**Thus, hybrid seeds have to be purchased again each year from the companies that create them.**”*

“*Genetic modification (GM) takes the control even one step further from the farmer. Seed companies have made and sold hybrids since the 1920s (starting with the Hybrid Corn Company, now a subsidiary of DuPont), but GM is a newer process involving direct manipulation of genes in the laboratory. Freed from the limits of natural sex, the gene engineer may combine traits of creatures that aren’t on speaking terms in the natural world: animal or bacterial genes spliced into the chromosomes of plants, for example, and vice versa.**The ultimate unnatural product of genetic engineering is a “terminator gene” that causes a crop to commit genetic suicide after one generation, just in case some maverick garmer might want to save seed from his expensive, patented crop, instead of purchasing it again from the company that makes it.**”*

Seeing a pattern here? There’s a clear commonality between GM and hybrid seeds not shared by heirlooms: the end game, for those people purchasing those seeds, is no end at all. Just a cycle of continuous purchase, plant, harvest, repeat. Money spent, year over year, generation over generation.

(Oh, and thanks to an explosive combo of conglomeration of seed and chemical companies–which own the rights to hybrid and GM seeds–plus deregulation of said companies, there’s something like 6 companies owning more than 80% of seed production and sales in America. Civil Eats has a [seed monopoly chart](https://civileats.com/2019/01/11/the-sobering-details-behind-the-latest-seed-monopoly-chart/) detailing their expanse. Be prepared to lose some sleep and start spontaneously cursing the seed aisle at Home Depot.)

**HEIRLOOM**

*“By contrast to both GM and hybridization, open-pollinated heirlooms are created the same way natural selection does it: by saving and producing specimens that show the best characteristics of their generation, thus gradually increasing those traits in the population.**Once bred to a given quality, those varieties yield the same characteristics again when their seeds are saved and grown, year after year.**”*

There’s one other deliciously persuasive factor to consider when deciding on what type of seeds to buy: taste, which Kingsolver reiterates in the book:*“Even a child who dislikes tomatoes could likely tell the difference between a watery mass-market tomato and a grandmotherly (if not pie-baking) heirloom. Vegetables achieve historical status only if they deserve it. Farmers are a class of people not noted for sentimentality or piddling around. Seeds get saved down the generations for a reason, or for many, and in the case of vegetables one reason is always flavor. Heirlooms are the tangiest or sweetest tomatoes, the most fragrant melons, the eggplants without a trace of bitterness.”*

I’m convinced. Sign me up and take all my money. May another watery tomato never pass my lips (well, a girl can dream.)

Alright, so what am I planting? Which beauty heirloom seeds did I select for my attempted garden? That’ll be my next post.
